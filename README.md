The interactive quiz application is a visually appealing, user-friendly web-based platform designed to enhance the learning experience through real-time feedback and 
intuitive navigation. The design of the application is both functional and aesthetic, making it engaging for users of all ages. The entire layout of the webpage is 
structured thoughtfully, dividing the screen into two main sections: the left panel dedicated to question numbers and the right panel displaying the current question and its 
corresponding answer options.

On the **left side of the webpage**, a vertical column showcases the question numbers from 1 up to the total number of questions included in the quiz (e.g., 10 or more). 
These question numbers are more than just static labels—they serve as dynamic indicators of the user’s progress and performance. When a user selects an answer and submits 
it, the corresponding question number changes color based on the correctness of their response. If the selected answer is correct, the respective question number box turns 
**green**, signaling a correct attempt. If the answer is incorrect, the box changes to **red**, indicating a wrong attempt. However, if a question remains **unattempted**, 
there is no color change; the number remains in its default styling. This interactive feedback mechanism offers immediate visual cues that help users track their responses 
easily and revisit any unanswered or incorrectly answered questions if needed.

On the **right side of the webpage**, the main content area displays one question at a time along with **four multiple-choice options**. The interface is clean and spacious, 
ensuring that each option is easily clickable. Upon selecting an answer and clicking the “Next” button, the application immediately provides feedback. If the selected option 
is correct, that option is highlighted in **green**, providing positive reinforcement. If the answer is incorrect, the chosen (wrong) option is shown in **red**, and 
simultaneously, the correct option is highlighted in **green**. This dual-color feedback helps users understand their mistakes and learn the correct answer in real-time.

Users progress through the quiz by clicking the **“Next”** button after each question. This button leads them sequentially from one question to the next until they reach the 
final one. The flow is smooth and intuitive, keeping the user engaged throughout the quiz experience. Once all questions are answered, a **“Submit”** button becomes 
available. Upon clicking this button, the application compiles the results and displays a summary of the user’s performance. This includes the **total score**, **number of 
correct and incorrect answers**, and optionally, **time taken** to complete the quiz.

An added aesthetic feature of this application is the **background image** that spans the entire webpage. This image can be customized to suit the theme of the quiz (e.g., 
educational, environmental, historical), providing a visually rich experience without distracting from the core content. The combination of interactive elements, real-time 
feedback, and a pleasing visual environment makes the quiz more enjoyable and motivating for users.

Overall, this quiz application is designed to be **responsive**, **accessible**, and **educational**, offering immediate insight into learning progress while keeping the 
interface engaging and visually consistent. It blends functional design with performance-enhancing features, making it a valuable tool for assessments, practice tests, or 
fun knowledge-based games.
